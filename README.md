# Visual Interpretation Toolkit
This study proposes a novel and online interactive toolkit (Visual Interpretation Toolkit) for collecting validation datasets across space and time based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. It has four key components, including (1) auxiliary information extraction tool (AIExT) for extracting multi-source auxiliary data to assist in visual interpretation; (2) single-year sample dataset visual interpretation tool (SSD_VIT) for collecting single-year land cover labels; (3) time-series information extraction tool (TimeIExT) for assigning initial time-series land cover labels; (4) time-series sample dataset visual interpretation tool (TSD_VIT) for determining time-series land cover information. The experimental results demonstrate that the comprehensive and user-friendly Visual Interpretation Toolkit proposed based on GEE opens a new approach to support the collection of single-year and time-series validation datasets.
